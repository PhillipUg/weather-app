<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This project's purpose is to practice Javascript concepts like Promises, Async/Await, Dom Manipulation, modularization among others.

* On first load, the app requests for the user's current location, if permission is granted. The app will diplay the weather at the user's geolocation.

* User is able to search for the weather of any city in the world by typing the city name i the search bar and pressing enter or the search button.

* User is able to toggle between showing temperature in either `Celsius` or `Fahrenheit` units.
